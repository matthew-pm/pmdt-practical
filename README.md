# PM Jr. Design Technologist Practical Brief

## Overview
These practicals are designed to test your skills and technique across both disciplines: front-end web development and UX design. You should complete the practicals according to the specifications within this document, and afterward respond to sets of questions defined within each directory (`questions.md` files).

## Instructions
This repository has been set up as template repo on GitHub, enabling you to easily [create your project repo](https://github.com/matthew-pm/pmdt-practical/generate) from it.

### Setup
- Follow the link above, or go to [matthew-pm/pmdt-practical](https://github.com/matthew-pm/pmdt-practical) and click the "Use this template" button
- Name the repo: `pmdt-practical-<your-initials>`, e.g., `pmdt-practical-ma`
- Set as Private

Once you've created the new repo, add the user [**matthew-pm**](https://github.com/matthew-pm) as a collaborator. This will give me easy access to your project repo. 


**Helpful GitHub docs:**
- [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
- [Inviting collaborators to a personal repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)


## Final Deliverable
Your project repo will serve as the final deliverable that will contain everything to be reviewed. All source code and other files related to the FE Dev practical should be included in `pmdt-fe/`. All design documents and other files related to the UX practical should be included in `pmdt-ux/`. 

For each practical, you should answer the questions within the repsective `summary.md` file. You may answer these directly in the file itself, or write a document in a different format and provide the file or URL (e.g. `.docx`, `.pages`, `.pdf`, Notion, Google Docs). If you use a web-based document type, include the URL at the top of the `questions.md` file.

## FE Dev Practical
Project Folder: `pmdt-fe`

Read [`pmdt-fe/README.md`](./pmdt-fe/README.md) for more info on the development environment that has been set up for you. The setup uses Parcel, a zero configuration build tool.

It's highlighy recommended to use the setup as is, with Parcel (no additional configuration should be required to complete the tasks). You can use as much or as little of the boilerplate as you'd like. **If you want to go fully vanilla without a build tool, that's perfectly fine**. In that case case, [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) will be used to review your code on a dev server unless otherwise noted in your README.

#### Code Rules & Requirements
In the review, we'd like to evaluate your skills and technique regarding HTML, CSS, and JS. Frameworks are not allowed, but certain build tools that provide support for common preprocessors and compilers are allowed.

- Your source code should consist of primarily HTML, CSS (or Sass), and JS files.
- Frameworks or libraries like React, Svelte, Vue, and Angular are **not allowed**
- Templating languages such as Handlebars and Liquid are **not allowed**.
- CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind are **not allowed**. 
- CSS tools that _are allowed_:
    - Sass (`.scss`)
    - PostCSS (Parcel can be configured for this easily)
    - CSS resets or variations of this concept, such as [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).
- You may use tools that help you modularize HTML (e.g., [PostHTML](https://parceljs.org/languages/html/#posthtml) & `posthtml-include`; this has already been configured)

### Assignment
Your task is to build a web page according to the given design. [View the design via an XD link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/05f9376c-2170-4cfb-b052-4a5dd381ecd5-50aa/grid). Make the rendered page look as close to the design as you can using your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and responsive design.

This practical is also intended to test your ability to analyze a design and extract or infer details that may not be annotated.

Read the annotations within the XD link's `Comments View` for additional specifications for the implementation.

The copy for the design can be pulled from the XD link's `Specs View` or from `pmdt-fe/copy.md`.

Some general things to consider with your code:
- Web development best practices
- "Good code"
- Responsive design

#### XD Links: Specs View
Click the `Specs View` (</> icon) to see information about the design, styles, and easily copy text. In this view, you can navigate around the artboard and inspect specific elements, see their spacing by hovering over adjacent elements, etc. Read more about how to [view and inspect design specs](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/help/inspect-design-specs.html) in XD links.

### Deliverables
- Your source code for the FE Dev Practical, within `pmdt-fe/`
- If you modify the initial setup to use a different build tool, you must update the npm scripts or document how to run your project
- Your answers to the questions in [`pmdt-fe/questions.md`](./pmdt-fe/questions.md)

## UX Design Practical
Project Folder: `pmdt-ux`
<!-- TODO -->

### Assignment
Your task is to design **Variant B** of the Minicart component for a theoretical A/B test. **Variant A**, the control design, is provided in an XD file: [`pmdt-ux/minicart.xd`](./pmdt-ux/minicart.xd). The XD file can also be [viewed on the web](#TODO). Variant A is also the existing implementation on the Peter Millar website.

**Note:** the Minicart and the Cart page are two separate entities. The Minicart is essentially a condensed version of the Cart page. Making changes to the Cart page is not part of this A/B test.

Assume the following statements are true:

- Our customers typically only purchase 1â€“2 items before checking out.
- Customers who add 3+ items to their cart typically never end up checking out.
- Peter Millar is a "Luxury Men's Fashion" brand.
- Peter Millar uses the text "Bag" or "Shopping Bag" when referencing the user's shopping cart on the site.

#### The Control
[desktop screenshot]

On desktop, the Minicart shows when adding a product, and when a user hovers on the Bag icon (when there is at least one product in their cart).

[mobile screenshot]

On mobile, the Minicart only shows temporarily after adding a product. (Clicking on the Bag icon takes users to the Cart page.)

To reproduce this UI state:
1. Navigate a product page
2. Select the product options (size, color, etc.) and click the "Add to Bag" button
3. The Minicart will automatically show


#### Hypothesis
If the Minicart overlay is a more immersive experience and draws users' focus to the content within it, users will be encouraged to proceed to checkout, increasing the conversion rate of completed purchases.


#### Other Requirements
You can use Adobe XD or Figma to design variant B. If you use Figma, include a link to your design file within this project repo. 

You should include any ideations or iterations. For example, if you created low-fidelity wireframes like sketches, include those too!

### Deliverables
- Design Document (XD or Figma). It should include:
  - Final comps of Variant B
  - Any non-final versions or iterations you want to share
- Your answers to the questions in [`pmdt-ux/questions.md`](./pmdt-ux/questions.md)
