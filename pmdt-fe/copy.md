Performance DNA with Stylish Soul

**DEK:**

Our Crown Crafted Stealth line was born from a desire to elevate innovative performance apparel, ramping up quality and revolutionizing construction to offer a unique twist on modern style. These are pieces that act and move as you’d expect from cutting-edge premium performance construction, with minimalist design, soft feel and subtle coloration that allow them to fly under-the-radar. Stealth transcends categories because it has redefined them, offering wide-ranging technical features while maintaining their stylish appeal.

Ultimate Comfort and Perpetual Style

**DEK:**

Similar to a luxury sports car, these pieces simultaneously offer sleek aesthetics and uncompromising performance. Their weather-resistant and stretch properties combine with quiet wear to make them ideal course apparel for the discerning golfer. Select pieces have been tested in major championships by #TeamPM ambassadors like Brandt Snedeker.

They’re also built to withstand even the most all-encompassing itineraries, with ultimate comfort and perpetual style. They seamlessly transition between cityscapes and clubhouse, from driving range to night on the town and back again without skipping a beat. 

The Stealth pieces are each designed with our Tailored Fit. In the pants and shorts, this manifests in a trimmer leg and subtly shorter rise than our Crown and Crown Sport offerings. In the outerwear, you’ll notice a trimmer fit throughout the shoulder, chest and waist.
